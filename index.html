            <p class="textbody">    Hi there!</p>
            <p class="textbody">    My name is Kai, this is my portfolio and hereâ€™s a little bit about me!</p>
            <p class="textbody">    I am currently getting certified in full stack web development at University of Washington and will receive my certificate in the end of this summer. While I have a comprehensive graphic design and front-end background, my emphasis is on back-end web development. I am classically trained in all adobe, Microsoft and Autodesk products. Upon being certified, I hope to work for a company that specializes in high level web development and eventually produce and create pages for a large firm. </p>
            <p class="textbody">    My current position as a Customer Support Specialist for Blueprint Technologies gives me valuable experience in the tech sector. My reputation as an important team member who always gets the job done comes from my demonstrated ability to multitask. I've worked on projects such as drafting company correspondence, preparing data reports for management, organizing company meetings and off-site events, and helping customers with tricky questions daily. My experience has taught me the importance of being proactive, and I pride myself on my ability to adapt to all kinds of situations as they arise.</p>
